``dockerasmus`` is a version-agnostic Python module that was created
to quickly solve docking problems, as part of a Python assignment from
the M1 BIBS of the Universit√© Paris-Saclay.

Dockerasmus provides a generic implementation of a scoring function,
which can be used with several *components* to compute the score of
a docking conformation of two proteins. It is backend agnostic, and
every scoring component can be rewritten with any library supporting
``numpy`` arrays.
