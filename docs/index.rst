Dockerasmus
=======================================
***A python module designed for docking**

|build| |coverage| 

Dockerasmus is a Python version-agnostic module that was created to
quickly solve docking problems, as part of a Python assignment from
the M1 BIBS of the Universit√© Paris-Saclay.

Dockerasmus provides a generic implementation of a scoring function,
which can be used with several *components* to compute the score of
a docking conformation of two proteins. It is backend agnostic, and
any component can be rewritten with another library.
